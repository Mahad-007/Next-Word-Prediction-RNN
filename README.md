# Next-Word-Prediction-RNN
This repository contains a project that implements a Next-Word Prediction Model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Python. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sentence based on its context, demonstrating key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning.
